# Stateless OpenPGP Protocol (SOP)

The [Stateless OpenPGP Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dkg-openpgp-stateless-cli/)
(short *SOP*) is a specification of a standardized command line interface for a limited set of OpenPGP operations.

By standardizing the interface, users are able to choose between different, compatible implementations.
